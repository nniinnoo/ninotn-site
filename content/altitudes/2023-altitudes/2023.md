There was a time when I was still in college where I tried rock climbing once and completely stopped afterward â€“ not because of a fear of heights, but I worried about potentially breaking my fingers and being unable to write code anymore. So, what's changed? Nothing really. I still have the same concerns. The only reason I'm giving it another shot is just because I can't freely go hiking in the mountains whenever I want. This time, I approach it cautiously and learn how to manage a muscle fatigue and scratches. It's better than isolating myself in front of computer all day, waiting for the right moment to go hiking again
