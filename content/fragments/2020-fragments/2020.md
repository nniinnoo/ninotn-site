February 12, 2020 <br/>
More than a month after the outbreak, Coronavirus finally got its new name -- Covid-19. Apparently the virus can survive for 5-20 days; on Twitter, I saw a video of bank officers in China disinfected enormous boxes of money to prevent the virus spreading. Chen Qiushi, a journalist who defied China's communist party monopoly by cover-up the information about the Coronavirus has been disappearing. People are getting obsessed with antibacterial soap and facial masks; I went to two mini marts only to find nothing. On the train people who use masks seeing each other with a suspicious gaze. Indonesia still has no reported Coronavirus, most people including WHO are not so happy about that. It sounds like a story of an old friend from school who never get a good mark then make a surprise with a perfect score, everyone is amazed, but no one believes.
