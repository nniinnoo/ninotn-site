<b>The Desert Lullaby</b>
<br />  
peace is a fatamorgana  
a time to heal the wound,  
to find the lost family  
to forget the unspeakable  
to make a new life  
to find a new love  
to gather allies  
to create more deadly weapons  
to break another promise
<br />  
and war, it's a long footsteps  
toward an oasis, which doesn't  
even there

<b>Seashore</b>
<br />  
one evening  
i silently calculated  
how many step i need  
to get to the seashore  
i sometimes imagine  
losing the person you know,  
or you love,
feels like losing  
all of my footsteps on the sand  
swept by the sea  
without purpose  
it erodes slowly, suddenly

I have no doubt that Ghozali 14.2M NFT phenomenon seems to me like a new kind of "Budi Setiawan from Binomo trading advertisement", a new kind of marketing strategy, they burn money directly with or without an agreement behind the curtain, where Binomo made the marketing so explicit, the NFT made it implicit to make it looks organic. The aim is clear, to attract Indonesia's huge and consumptive market.
