                As a kid, the story of Genesis always fascinated me. I first
                heard it from my grandmother, "In the beginning.." she said,
                then repeated by people around with the same enthusiasm that the
                fruit eaten by Adam and Eve was an actual forbidden fruit,
                guarded by an evil snake in a place called the Garden of Eden.
                It gave the impression as if it really existed somewhere up
                there, beyond the sky, and one day we could visit it during
                holiday. I found it strange and beautiful as a bedtime story to
                cover something we didn't have an explanation for. It made me
                imagine how the fruit might look, how it tasted, and wonder if
                there could be any other kind of fruit. As I grew up, I buried
                most of those childhood fairytales, but I chose to spare this
                one, as a souvenir, to remind me of that innocent time. So, in
                order to not let it die uncovered, I try to give it a new
                uniform and see it far from different dimensions.

                    Sitting by the campfire, I listen to the snake’s voice
                    again. It is old and raspy without temptation; it feels like
                    a call that once told us to discover ancient flame, to
                    unveil something powerful in every breath that obeys the
                    order and laws of number, to kiss the sun and steal the ring
                    of Saturn, to fill the cosmos with our everlasting dreams,
                    until we lost again in search of ourselves. “Eat the fruit
                    slowly, bit by bit, digest it and you will understand," said
                    the snake. Then I fall, flooded with a lot of pain and
                    suffering. "Cross that border, go away to a place beyond
                    your intuition, and never give up," the snake repeated. "Who
                    are you?" I asked. "I am, your curiosity".

                a website, I try to imagine if he did. So, I steal his principle

                really.. hard. I still consider this blog unfinished. After all,
                I decided to roam around and refine it from time to time, but so

                As a child, there was a moment when I didn't quite understand
                why my parents spoke in different local languages with their
                families, but used Bahasa with each other. I thought they had
                their own secret language. Growing up, I took all of the
                diversity for granted and never made any further effort to learn
                them. I went to different schools and learned various extra
                languages. Below are the languages I've learned so far:

                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  My native language. I learned the theoretical aspect from
                  elementary to high school. It's a phonetic language
                  (pronounced as it is written) like Spanish or Italian, with
                  simple grammar and without gendered nouns. The language has a
                  lot of loanwords from Dutch, Portuguese, Sanskrit, Arabic, and
                  Mandarin. Bahasa Indonesia is quite similar to Malay, so if
                  you know Bahasa, or vice versa, you can quickly understand the
                  other. If you're interested to learn the language, using
                  Duolingo, or GPT (with precaution) is a good start to grasp
                  the basic idea. While I don't have any good theoretical
                  resources to share, I can recommend books or movies to give a
                  sense of the culture; feel free to ask me. For now, I will put
                  here the list of popular Indonesian literature that you might

                  Advanced (B2 - C1 level). The origin started around the age of
                  9 because of an RPG game, "Final Fantasy VIII". I had to look
                  up a thick dictionary every time the dialogues popped up and
                  write them down on a piece of paper. Back then, it's almost
                  impossible to find a game in Bahasa. The same habit continued
                  with mostly video games and songs, but I never watched films
                  with English subtitles because I hated rewinding them every
                  time. For the most part, I learned it from regular English
                  classes in school. Up until the end of high school, except for
                  articles, I never really read any literature in English. The
                  first book that I fully read in English was a very thin
                  "Sherlock Holmes: Scandal in Bohemia" that I borrowed from the
                  university library. Along the way I increased the difficulty
                  by reading more challenging books, but I still struggled with
                  my speaking articulation since I rarely practiced it, not
                  until I started working in an international work environment
                  where I interacted with colleagues from different countries.
                  In an attempt to improve, I practiced monologues and used an
                  association technique to describe lists of pictures within a
                  time limit. I'm still maintaning English to this day, and
                  there are still so many intersting thing that I pick up when I
                  read or heard something. Takeaways: To study grammar I
                  strongly recommend this book:{" "}

                  It contains plenty of exercises and good grammatical ideas
                  that you can easily digest. For the other aspects, I put in
                  the footnotes, as I use similar ways to study other languages.

                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  Very Basic. During junior high school, I attended a
                  Buddhist-based school and learned Mandarin for 3 years. I
                  didn't maintain it and almost completely forgot everything,
                  though I still remember some characters, numbers, and phrases.
                  For me, apart from the tricky aspects like tones and
                  characters, the hardest part was finding the motivation to
                  learn, it feels too dry and I didn't feel like their pop
                  cultures hold me like the way Japanese or French does. But who
                  knows, it was a long time ago, maybe I'll return someday if I
                  have the time.

                  Basic (A1 level). I attended public senior high school and
                  learned German for 2 years. If I had to pick one of my
                  favorite class throughout my school years, it would be German.
                  Not because it's easy, German is still impossible, too many
                  arbitrary and complex grammar rules, but Frau Suzana made all
                  of it unforgettable. What she taught us, was not just
                  language, but enthusiasm and open mindedness. She literally
                  made us sing, dance, and cry in class. She peacefully
                  persuaded even the most timid or rebellious students to
                  express their feelings towards people they liked or disliked,
                  and reconcile differences. I didn't know if she had read too
                  much Freud or Jung, but I felt like she was a psychologist in
                  disguise. Back to the language, after high school I didn't
                  maintain it for many years, until about pandemic era, I
                  decided to keep in touch with German via Duolingo and Youtube
                  channel like{" "}
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EasyGerman">Easy German</a>.
                  Since I have a few German friends, sometimes it's fun to try
                  to figure out what they're talking about with my limited
                  vocabulary.

                  Intermediate (B2). Learning this language has been more like a
                  self-discovery for me. The motivation I mentioned earlier, I
                  found it in French through a series of events. It began to
                  take shape in junior high school when I first read the story
                  about Fermat's Last Theorem in a Japanese manga. During high
                  school, I read Albert Camus's <i>The Stranger</i>. In
                  university, I watched many French movies and read more books
                  by French writers. When I opened my science and math
                  textbooks, they were filled with French names (Pascal,
                  Laplace, Fourier, Lagrange, Cauchy, Descartes, Fermat and, so
                  on). I even used Laplacian and Fourier transform in my thesis.
                  All of these are potential catalysts, but the final triggers
                  happened when there were 2 visiting professors from France in
                  our lab, and my advisor asked me to assist them during their
                  stay.

                  Later, after I had started working, I came across a blog
                  article by Eka Kurniawan (an Indonesian author) that talked
                  about his effort to read Marcel Proust's{" "}
                  <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> in the original French{" "}
                  <i>À la recherche du temps perdu</i>. "There was a feeling I
                  can't describe when I read him in his own voice," said Eka.
                  That day, I determined to learn French. "I'm going to read
                  Camus in his own language" I said to myself. Since France is
                  not fully a phonetic language, I thought it would be better to
                  learn the pronunciation from a tutor right from the start
                  rather than doubling my effort to fix it later. So, I took a
                  French course every Saturday at one of the French institutes
                  in Jakarta. Later, when I reached DELF A2, it was just at the
                  beginning of the pandemic. I returned to my hometown and
                  learned the rest of the level by myself. I spent about a week
                  gathering reliable resources, methods and building my own
                  framework.

                Resources are abundant out there; people say many things. Most
                of them are good if you can implement, but some are harder to
                follow, so we have to adapt them to our needs. For my part,
                these have been quite effective habits, and I have faithfully
                followed them until now:
                <br />
                <div
                  style={{

                  <ol>
                    1. I strongly encourage everyone to build their own SRS
                    vocabulary with context (start simple, bit by bit so you
                    don't feel overwhelmed); you can find some of the good
                    examples in{" "}

                    2. Don't just review, try to recall as much as possible, and
                    don't add more study if you can't recall 90% of the previous
                    study.
                  </ol>
                  <ol>
                    3. To practice speaking, prepare a list of pictures and
                    describe them for 3-5 minutes without stopping, as if
                    talking to someone. If a picture is difficult to describe,
                    associate it with something familiar. If you're stuck on a
                    word (but know how to say it in your native language), write
                    it down and look it up later, then explain why it's hard to
                    describe. Listen to your recording, and notice the words
                    that you find hard to pronounce, and refine it (you can
                    check on <a href="https://fr.forvo.com/">Forvo</a> or Google
                    translate).

                  <ol>
                    4. To practice listening, podcast is a great start (find a
                    topic that interests you and listen it MANY TIMES). I also
                    often watch stand-up comedy, as they convey memorable
                    punchlines and cultural references. And, don't forget about
                    music, scrutinize the lyrics.
