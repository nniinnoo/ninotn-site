                As a kid, the story of Genesis always fascinated me. I first
                heard it from my grandmother, then the same repetition from
                people around, with the same voice that the fruit eaten by Adam
                and Eve was an actual forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden,
                guarded by a random snake. It's a beautiful bedtime story for
                something we don't know and have the explanation for. It made me
                imagine how this fruit might look like, how it tastes, and
                wondered if there could be a "blessed" fruit too. As I grew up,
                I doubt it and distance myself from the fairytales and see it
                from a different direction. My aim is not to make corrections
                about the story, but to give it a new uniform. One night,
                sitting by the campfire outside my tent, I imagined the snakeâ€™s
                voice differently, like the voice that told us to discover fire,
                to find a way to create something more intelligent than us, and
                to lose once again in search of ourselves. Whether the snake is
                wrong or not, it doesn't matter. It said we were gaining wisdom
                out of it. But it forgot to tell us that it comes with a lot of
                pain and suffering. And yet, despite everything, we still choose
                to eat the same fruit.

                  I grew up in a sleepy little town in Sumatra, surrounded by
                  mountains and sea-facing Indian Ocean. After high school, I
                  took my first sail to study computer science and mathematics.
                  Later, I began my professional career as a software engineer
                  in Jakarta. These days I mostly write code around JavaScript &
                  TypeScript for work, and in C++ and Python for fun. I also
                  enjoy juggling trick practice, chess, playing guitar/piano,
                  drawing, capture a moment, & searching for nature in spare
                  time.
